# User Switching - Implementation Summary

## âœ… Implementation Complete

User switching feature has been successfully implemented, allowing super admins and admins to switch to other user accounts for testing and debugging purposes.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Was Built

### 1. API Endpoint (`app/api/auth/switch-user/route.ts`)

**POST** - Switch to another user:
- Validates admin/super admin permissions
- Prevents regular admins from switching to super admins
- Fetches target user details and permissions
- Preserves original user ID in session
- Logs the switch action
- Returns switch data for session update

**DELETE** - Switch back to original user:
- Restores original user session
- Clears switched state
- Logs the switch back action
- Returns original user data

### 2. Session Management (`lib/auth.ts`)

Added JWT callback handling for:
- `originalUserId` - Preserved across switch
- `isSwitched` - Boolean flag for switch state
- `switchData` - Full user context update on switch

Session callback updated to include:
- Switch state in session user object
- Proper type safety with TypeScript

### 3. TypeScript Types (`types/next-auth.d.ts`)

Extended NextAuth interfaces:
- `Session.user` - Added `originalUserId` and `isSwitched`
- `User` - Added switch-related fields
- `JWT` - Added switch state tracking

### 4. User Switcher Component (`components/admin/UserSwitcher.tsx`)

Features:
- **Modal UI** with searchable user list
- **Real-time filtering** by username, name, or email
- **Switch/Switch Back buttons** with distinct styling
- **Loading states** during operations
- **Error handling** with toast notifications
- **Visual indicators** for switched state
- **Security checks** - Only shows for admins
- **Excludes current user** from switch list

### 5. Sidebar Integration (`components/admin/Sidebar.tsx`)

Updates:
- Imported `UserSwitcher` component
- Added `isSwitched` state from session
- **Yellow warning badge** when switched ("Testing Mode")
- **Yellow avatar** instead of blue when switched
- Placed switcher below user info, above Help link
