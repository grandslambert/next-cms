feat: Add Navigation Menu System (v1.15.0)

Complete WordPress-style navigation menu builder with:

- Three menu item types: Post Type (archives/posts), Taxonomy archives, Custom links
- Post search with real-time filtering (published posts only)
- Remembers last selected menu per user, auto-loads on page load
- WordPress-style drag-and-drop: reorder items, drag left/right to control hierarchy
- Visual drop zones showing exact insert position with indent level indicator
- Hierarchical parent/child structure with visual indentation and borders
- Inline editing with arrow icons (â–¼ open, â–² close) on right side
- Advanced fields: Title Attribute, CSS Classes, Link Relationship (XFN), Description
- Batch saving: Creates new items, updates existing, saves meta, processes deletions with loading overlay
- Sticky header with Delete/Cancel/Update buttons (disabled when no changes)
- Unsaved changes warning when switching menus
- Modular component architecture (5 components for better maintainability)
- Activity logging for all menu operations with before/after tracking
- New manage_menus permission for role-based access
- Database tables: menus, menu_items, menu_item_meta, menu_locations with cascade deletes
- Menu Locations: built-in locations (header, footer, sidebar) protected from deletion
- Location radio buttons in menu form with descriptions for better UX
- New Appearance sidebar menu (ðŸŽ¨) with Menus and Menu Locations submenus
- Public template integration: menus render in header and footer locations
- Menu helper functions for server-side rendering with full meta data support
- Hierarchical URL building for nested pages (e.g., /parent/child/grandchild)
- Menu items display actual names (post titles, labels) instead of IDs
- Link target options (_self, _blank) for same/new window

Fixed:
- Last selected menu properly loads from user preferences with loading spinner
