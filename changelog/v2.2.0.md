## Changed
- **Import/Export System** - Significantly enhanced backup and migration capabilities
  - Export API now supports format parameter (json, xml, csv, sql, zip)
  - Import API now handles ZIP files with automatic extraction
  - Added archiver package for ZIP creation
  - Added jszip package for ZIP extraction
  - Updated export endpoint to return different content types based on format
  - Media files can now be included in Full ZIP exports
  - **Activity Logging**: All import/export operations are now logged in the activity log
    - Export logs include format, data types exported, and item counts
    - Import logs include file type, summary, and detailed statistics
    - Both operations include IP address and user agent for audit trail

## Fixed
- **Export File Extensions** - Downloads now use correct file extensions based on format
  - Frontend now reads filename from Content-Disposition header
  - Previously all exports were incorrectly named with .json extension
  - Each format now downloads with its proper extension (.xml, .zip, .sql, .json)
- **Multi-Site API Routes** - Comprehensive fix to ensure all routes are site-aware
  - **Menu Locations**: GET and POST routes now use site-prefixed tables
  - **Scheduled Posts Processor**: Now processes scheduled posts across all active sites
  - **Media Bulk Operations**: Trash, restore, move, and permanent delete now site-aware
  - **Media Trash Management**: Empty trash and permanent delete now site-aware
  - **Media Move**: Move media between folders now site-aware
  - All operations now correctly query and update site-specific tables using `getSiteTable()`
  - Activity logging now includes `siteId` for proper audit trails
  - Each site now has complete data isolation
- **Navigation/Menus Page** - Fixed infinite loading and menu update failures
  - Page now properly handles empty menu state
  - `menuPreferenceLoaded` is now set even when no menus exist
  - Users can now access the page to create their first menu
  - **Menu Item Metadata**: Fixed meta save endpoint to be site-aware (`/api/menu-items/[id]/meta`)
  - **Menu Item Reorder**: Fixed reorder endpoint to be site-aware (`/api/menu-items/reorder`)
  - Both endpoints now use `getSiteTable()` for proper multi-site support
  - Menu updates now save correctly without errors
  
**Complete Multi-Site Audit Results:**
After comprehensive review of ALL 58 API routes, confirmed that all site-specific operations are properly isolated:
- ✅ All 58 API routes audited
- ✅ All routes querying site-specific tables use `getSiteTable()`
- ✅ Complete data isolation between sites achieved
- ✅ Only 2 routes needed fixes (menu item meta and reorder - now corrected)
- ✅ All posts, media, taxonomies, terms, settings, menus, and post types routes properly site-aware
- **Post Type Deletion**: Fixed incorrect field name in deletion check
  - Was checking `post_type_id` (doesn't exist) 
  - Now correctly checks `post_type` (VARCHAR field with post type name)
  - Post types can now be deleted when no posts are using them

## Technical Details
- New dependencies: archiver, @types/archiver, jszip
- Export route uses Node.js fs and path modules for file operations
- ZIP archives use streaming with archiver for memory efficiency
- Import route automatically detects file type by extension
- All export formats properly escape special characters
- SQL dumps use prepared statement compatible format
- Frontend extracts filename from Content-Disposition header for correct file extensions
