# Version 1.17.1 - 2025-10-16

## Fixed
- Export functionality now uses simplified queries for better MySQL compatibility
- Meta data (posts, menu items) fetched separately and attached in JavaScript for better reliability
- Import now properly handles array-based meta data format
- Taxonomy export now works correctly (exports taxonomies, terms, and term relationships)
- User export now works correctly with proper column names (username, first_name, last_name)
- Post types, taxonomies, and media import now use correct column names matching current schema
- Media export now includes media_folders, and import processes folders before media files
- Import validates foreign key references (folder_id, uploaded_by) and handles missing references gracefully
- Menu items import now includes post_type column matching database schema
- Menu items import now properly remaps parent_id references to handle hierarchical menu structures
- Posts import now validates foreign keys (featured_image_id, author_id, parent_id) and remaps hierarchical post relationships
- Posts import includes scheduled_publish_at column
- Fixed incorrect table name references (term_relationships vs post_terms)
- **Database schema.sql table ordering** - Fixed foreign key constraint errors by reordering tables (media_folders and media now created before posts and terms)
