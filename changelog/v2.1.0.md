# Version 2.1.0 - 2025-10-17

## Added
- **Guest Role** - New system role for read-only public access
  - Added "Guest" role (ID: 4) with no permissions
  - Guests cannot access admin area (no dashboard permission)
  - Middleware blocks guests from all /admin routes
  - Dashboard redirects guests to homepage
  - Useful for public users who don't need admin access
  - Protected system role (cannot be edited/deleted)
- **Site-Specific Roles** - Administrators can now create custom roles scoped to their site
  - New `site_id` column in roles table (NULL = global/system role)
  - Site admins can create roles that only apply to their site
  - Super admins can create global roles available across all sites
  - Roles list shows badge with site name for site-specific roles (e.g., "Site 1")
  - System roles show "System" badge, global custom roles show "Global" badge
  - Site admins only see system roles + their site's custom roles
  - Super admins see all roles across all sites
  - Site-specific roles are automatically scoped when created by site admins
  - Site-specific roles can only be deleted by site admins who created them
  - Super Administrator role hidden from non-super admins for security
  - Prevents role name conflicts between sites (unique constraint per site)
- **Site Role Overrides** - Site admins can customize system roles without affecting other sites
  - New `site_role_overrides` table stores site-specific permission modifications
  - Site admins can edit system roles (Admin, Editor, Author, Guest) - changes only affect their site
  - Super admins editing system roles updates the global default (affects sites without overrides)
  - Customized roles show "Customized" badge (yellow) for site admins
  - Overrides automatically loaded for site admins when viewing roles
  - Each site can have different permissions for the same role
  - Example: Site 1 "Editor" can publish, Site 2 "Editor" cannot - completely independent

## Fixed
- **Role Permissions** - Added missing `can_reassign` permission to default roles
  - Administrator has `can_reassign: true` (can change post authors)
  - Editor has `can_reassign: false` (cannot change post authors)
  - Author has `can_reassign: false` (cannot change post authors)
  - Only Administrators can reassign authors by default
