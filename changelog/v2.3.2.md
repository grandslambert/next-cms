# Version 2.3.2 - October 17, 2025

## Changed

### Test Suite Organization
Reorganized API test scripts:
- Moved all test scripts to `tests/api/` directory
- Created `load-env.ps1` helper to automatically load credentials from `.env` file
- Tests now support loading from `.env` for local development
- Environment variables take precedence over `.env` file
- Updated all test scripts to use centralized environment loading

## Added

### Test Infrastructure
- `run-all-tests.ps1` - Master test runner for all API test suites
- `load-env.ps1` - Environment variable loader with `.env` file support
- Comprehensive `README.md` in `tests/api/` with setup instructions
- Support for both local `.env` configuration and CI/CD environment variables

## Documentation

- Complete test suite documentation in `tests/api/README.md`
- Setup instructions with multiple configuration options
- Troubleshooting guide for common test issues
- CI/CD integration examples

## Summary

Version 2.3.2 improves the developer experience by reorganizing the test suite into a dedicated directory and adding automatic `.env` file loading. This makes it easier to run tests locally while still supporting CI/CD environments. The test infrastructure now includes a master test runner and comprehensive documentation for all 71 API tests.
