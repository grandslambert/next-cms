  - Autosave indicator showing "Saving...", "Draft saved", and last saved time
  - Saves title, content, excerpt, custom fields, and page attributes (parent, menu order, author)
  - Stored per user and per post in user_meta table, separate for new vs existing posts
  - **Visual diff modal on page load** comparing current vs autosaved content side-by-side

  - Only prompts for autosaves within last 24 hours
  - Clears autosave after successful post publish or update
  - API endpoints for save, load, and clear autosave data
