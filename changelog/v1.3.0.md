# Version 1.3.0 - 2025-08-19

## Added
- **Custom Post Types** (WordPress-style)
  - Create custom content types (portfolios, products, events, testimonials, etc.)
  - Content Types â†’ Post Types management interface
  - Configure post type labels, icons, and menu positions
  - Toggle features per post type (title, content, excerpt, featured image, categories)
  - Option to show/hide post types in dashboard content summary
  - **Hierarchical support** for parent/child relationships (like WordPress Pages)
  - Parent selector and menu order for hierarchical post types
  - Dynamic admin sidebar menu items based on registered post types
  - Separate admin pages for each custom post type
  - Post type-specific create and edit interfaces

  - Database migration script for existing installations
  - Cannot delete built-in post types ("post" and "page") or types with existing content
  - Slug validation (lowercase, alphanumeric, underscores only)
  - UTF8MB4 charset support for emoji icons

## Changed
- **Unified Content System**
  - Pages are now a custom post type (`post_type = 'page'`) instead of separate table
  - All content (posts, pages, custom types) managed through unified posts table
  - Removed hardcoded "Pages" menu item - now handled as custom post type
  - Migrated existing pages to posts table with post_type = 'page'
  - Pages post type is hierarchical by default
  - Removed legacy `/admin/pages` and `/api/pages` routes

## Breaking Changes
- **Pages Table Deprecated**: Pages are now in the posts table with `post_type = 'page'`
- **API Changes**: Use `/api/posts?post_type=page` instead of `/api/pages`
- **Migration Required**: Run `scripts/migrate-pages-to-posts.js` for existing installations
- **Pages Table**: Can be dropped after confirming migration success: `DROP TABLE pages;`
