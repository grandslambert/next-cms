# Version 3.0.1 - October 20, 2025

## Fixed

### Dependencies
- **Removed MySQL2** - Removed `mysql2` package dependency as all code has been fully migrated to MongoDB

### Post Type Support Configuration
- **Post Types**:
  - Fixed default support configuration for Posts to include all features:
    - `title`, `editor` (content), `thumbnail` (featured image), `excerpt`, `comments`, `custom_fields`, `author`
  - Fixed default support configuration for Pages to include all features:
    - `title`, `editor` (content), `thumbnail` (featured image), `excerpt`, `custom_fields`, `author`
  - Updated `scripts/init-mongodb.ts` to create post types with complete feature support
  
- **API Routes**:
  - Fixed TypeScript errors in `app/api/post-types/[id]/route.ts` with proper type casting for `.lean()` results
  - Added type assertions to prevent "Property does not exist" errors when accessing MongoDB lean documents

### Database Initialization
- Updated database initialization script to ensure Posts and Pages support all CMS features by default
- This ensures the post editor displays all UI components (editor, featured image, custom fields, taxonomies)

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `scripts/init-mongodb.ts` - Updated default post type support arrays
- `app/api/post-types/[id]/route.ts` - Added type casting for MongoDB lean queries

### Impact
- Users initializing a fresh database with `npm run db:init:clear` will now have Posts and Pages with full feature support
- Post editor will display all expected UI components (editor, featured image, custom fields, taxonomies)
- Existing databases can be updated by running `npm run db:init:clear` or manually updating post type supports in MongoDB
